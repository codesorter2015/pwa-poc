# PWA POC
Progressive Web Apps known as Installable Web Apps or Hybrid Web Apps, but can appear to the user like traditional applications or native applications or native mobile applications.

In 2015, designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell coined the term "Progressive Web Apps" to describe apps taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers, including service workers and web app manifests.

They offer an immersive full screen experience with help of a web app manifest file and can even re-engage users with web push notifications.

You can deploy your app as a PWA as well as Native app and take advantage of both channels. Ionic allows you to ship your app to not only the app store, but also deploy to the mobile web as a PWA.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are the next big thing in web development as they bring mobile-app-like experiences to your users without requiring them to install an app from the app store/ play store.
